# UE4-IO-System
IO-System for UE4 based on Source Engine's IO-System

This was made for my personal use and is most likely unstable,
I do not recommend using this for any of your projects.

The AInputOutput class inherits the AActor class for Networking to work properly,
an UActorComponent version might be released at some point but it will not support Networking.
